## Pages üìÑ

### My Plants
- Displays a table with details about each plant.
- Allows creating new plants using a form with validation.
- Includes a button to add watering records for plants.

### Watering History
- Displays a history of watering events with details like date and related plant.

## Functional Highlights üåü

### Adding a Plant
- Uses a form built with React Hook Form and Zod for validation.
- Validates fields like plant name, type, watering frequency, and location.
- Saves data to the backend using Axios.

### Adding a Watering Record
- Each plant row in the "My Plants" page includes a "Water Plant" button.
- Clicking the button:
  - Adds a watering record for the current date.
  - Ensures no duplicate records for the same plant on the same date.
  - Updates the next watering date and recalculates the plant's status (`OK`, `Overdue`, or `Due Soon`).

### Plant Status and Calculations
- **Status**:
  - `OK`: Plant does not need watering.
  - `Due Soon`: Plant needs watering within 2 days.
  - `Overdue`: Plant is past its watering date.
- **Calculations**:
  - Determines the next watering date based on the last watered date and watering frequency.
  - Ensures all status updates are dynamic and reflect the current state of the plant.

## Known Limitations üõ†Ô∏è
- The "Water Plant" feature automatically adds a record for the current date. There is no option to select a custom date due to time constraints.
- Test coverage is not included but would be implemented using tools like Jest or React Testing Library in future iterations.
